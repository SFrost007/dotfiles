These items are left as post-setup steps for the user to do.

* Setup MS Keyboard modifiers (`bin/SetupKeyboardModifiers`)
* Change Spotlight keyboard shortcut, set up Alfred in its place
* Install Xcode (via App Store or developer portal)
* brew install sourcery - if needed, requires full Xcode install first
